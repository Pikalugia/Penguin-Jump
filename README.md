<h1><b>Penguin Jump</b></h1>

Penguin Jump is a custom version of Google's offline dinosaur game for their Google Chrome browser. It's utilized as an easter egg on the <a href="https://www.peekio.no/404">404 page of the Peekio website.</a> (Must be played on a Computer).

The textures are ripped from Penguin Palace, one of the original (now closed) games from Peekio.
